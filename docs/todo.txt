Issues

- 검사하기 parses as (검사 + 하 (HadaVerb) + 기 (NominalizedVerb)) - ['검사:NNG', '하:XSV', '기:ETN']
   but I think 기 here is a verb making a causative verb out of 검사하다 (it was on a web-page button).  Khaiii classifies it as ETN, noun-modifier
   or is 검사하기 a 명사 or 도사?

- is 아니면 always "or"?  Khaiii sees it as '아니:VCN;면:EC'
